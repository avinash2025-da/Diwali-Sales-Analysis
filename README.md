# Diwali-Sales-Analysis
Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, and Data Visualization Using Python 
This project focuses on analyzing Diwali sales data using Python. The dataset contains customer purchase information such as gender, age group, city, product category, and amount spent. First, I cleaned the data by removing missing or unnecessary entries. Then, I analyzed customer behavior and purchase trends during the Diwali season. Finally, I identified patterns that can help businesses improve marketing and sales strategies for future festive seasons.

*Key Insights:*
1. Female customers from the age group 26-35 were the highest contributors to overall sales.
2. Tier-1 cities showed the highest total purchase amount, indicating stronger buying power.
3. The "Food and Clothing" category had the highest number of orders and revenue.
4. Most purchases were made by customers in the 26-45 age range, making them a key target group.
5. A few customers made multiple high-value purchases, showing the importance of loyal buyers.
